# Speed-and-Balanced-Controlled-Sound-Reverse-Car

Throughout this course, we have studied techniques for turning environmental stimuli and
translating them into electrical signals which can be used to control a small robotic car. These skills have
culminated in our final project, a car with wheel speed and balance control which reverses when a clap
occurs. The methods we use in this project (that we have learned throughout this lab) can be adapted for
many different applications, which can address a multitude of differing stimuli with unique responses.
